# autospe
In work.

R package allowing a quick and simple analysis of a naturalist dataset. Use, among other things, some functions of the vegan package. The advantage is to have the analysis results directly from a long format dataset, in one command, without having to modify the dataset or create a matrix. A tool designed to quickly work on several data sets to compare.
